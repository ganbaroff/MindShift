# MindShift — Claude Working Memory

## Project
**MindShift** — ADHD-aware productivity PWA. Mobile-first, React + TypeScript + Supabase.
Owner: **Yusif** (ganbarov.y@gmail.com). Branch: `main` @ latest. Status: **production-ready v1.0**. Google Play launch pending account verification.

## Stable Production URL
**`https://mind-shift-git-main-yusifg27-3093s-projects.vercel.app`**
- This URL never changes — always the latest `main` branch production build
- Auto-updates on every `git push origin main` (Vercel GitHub integration)
- Works from any device / network without auth
- Custom domain: add via Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Domains

## E2E Testing
- Framework: `@playwright/test` (already in package.json)
- Local: `npx playwright test` (starts dev server automatically)
- Production: `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://mind-shift-git-main-yusifg27-3093s-projects.vercel.app npx playwright test`
- CI auto-run: `.github/workflows/e2e-production.yml` fires after every successful Vercel deploy via `deployment_status` event
- Browsers: Chromium + iPhone 14 (mobile)
- All Supabase API calls are mocked via `page.route()` — tests run offline

- **React.memo:** TaskCard (custom comparator), ArcTimer, MochiSessionCompanion, BurnoutAlert
- **CSS tokens:** `:root` vars + `[data-mode="calm"]` overrides. App.tsx sets data-mode from reducedStimulation.
- **Error boundaries:** Per-route `<ErrorBoundary fallback={<RouteError />}>` + BentoGrid chunk fallback (Sprint 9)
- **ADRs:** 7 documented in `docs/adr/` (rate-limiting, Zustand, offline, PWA, colors, AI, accessibility)

## Architecture (Sprint 9 additions)
- **Motion system:** All components now wired to `useMotion()`. No bypasses. All `animate-spin` gated by `motion-reduce:animate-none`.
- **Focus rings:** Button.tsx + all interactive elements have `focus-visible:ring-2` (WCAG 2.4.7 AA)
- **DueDateScreen:** Replaces non-functional CalendarScreen. Groups tasks by Today/Tomorrow/This Week/Later.
- **Offline indicator:** AppShell shows gold bar when offline, teal confirmation on reconnect.
- **Undo completion:** TaskCard holds completion for 4s with toast. Confetti fires immediately.
- **Timer style UI:** Now settable in SettingsScreen (was only in store with no UI).

## Architecture (Sprint D–H additions)
- **useTaskSync:** `src/shared/hooks/useTaskSync.ts` — bidirectional Supabase↔store sync. Server-wins on login. Local-push on first device. Surfaces fetch errors as sonner toast.
- **useSessionHistory:** `src/shared/hooks/useSessionHistory.ts` — fetches last 30 days of focus_sessions, computes WeeklyStats, calls `weekly-insight` edge function once per mount.
- **SW push handlers:** `src/sw.ts` — `push` renders OS notification, `notificationclick` opens app URL.
- **OnboardingPage:** 5-step flow — step 5 is notification permission with "Skip for now". TOTAL_STEPS = 5.
- **AddTaskModal:** Due date picker (Today/Tomorrow chips + native date input). Auto-schedules reminder 15 min before due date when Notification.permission === 'granted'. Reset on close via handleClose().
- **TaskCard:** React.memo with custom comparator (id/status/title/dueDate/difficulty). 🔔 badge when reminder active. 📅 due date pill.
- **Performance:** useMemo on filtered task lists in HomePage + TasksPage. React.memo on TaskCard.
- **Accessibility:** EnergyPicker aria-label+aria-pressed. Fab aria-label+focus-visible ring. CollapsibleSection aria-expanded+aria-label.

## Architecture (Sprint AA additions)
- **Google OAuth:** `AuthScreen.tsx` — "Continue with Google" button using `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google' })`. Consent persisted to localStorage before redirect (same pattern as magic link). `prompt: 'select_account'` query param forces Google account picker. Requires: Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Google (enable + set OAuth credentials). `googleLoading` state prevents double-clicks.
- **User Behavior Memory:** `src/shared/hooks/useUserBehavior.ts` — `useUserBehavior(sessions: FocusSessionRow[]): UserBehaviorProfile`. Computes from existing focus_sessions: avgSessionMinutes, flowRate, struggleDropRate (0-1), peakHour, avgEnergy, energyTrend (improving/stable/declining from first-5 vs last-5 energy_after), completedToday (from store pools), recentStruggles (human-readable string combining up to 4 patterns: struggle drop, short sessions, low flow rate, declining energy). Memoized on [sessions, pools].
- **AI Mochi (mochi-respond):** `supabase/functions/mochi-respond/index.ts` — Gemini 2.5 Flash edge function. Receives trigger + full user context (psychotype, ADHD signals, behavior profile, seasonal mode). Returns `{ message, mascotState }`. System prompt positions Mochi as warm ADHD-aware companion (not coach, not therapist). Psychotype-specific tone guidance. 8s timeout, 0.9 temperature, 150 max tokens. Rate limit: 10/day free. Structured output: `MESSAGE: .../STATE: ...` format with parsing.
- **MochiSessionCompanion upgrade:** Shows hardcoded fallback message immediately on trigger, then fires async AI request. If AI responds before bubble is dismissed (8s window), replaces the text seamlessly via `setActiveBubble` callback. Guest users → hardcoded only (no API call). New `behaviorProfile` prop fed from `useUserBehavior` in FocusScreen.
- **Mascot `encouraging` state:** `src/shared/ui/Mascot.tsx` — new visual state: warm purple+teal gradient with teal glow, cheeks visible, wider smile. Used by AI Mochi for comeback/struggle triggers.

## Architecture (Sprints X–Z additions)
- **Focus Rooms (Sprint X):** `src/shared/hooks/useFocusRoom.ts` — `useFocusRoom()` hook manages Supabase Realtime channel `focus-room:{code}` with presence protocol. States: idle/connecting/connected/error. `create()` → 4-char code via `Math.random().toString(36)`. `join(code)` → subscribes. `broadcast(phase)` → `channel.track({ phase })`. `leave()` → `untrack` + `removeChannel`. `src/features/focus/FocusRoomSheet.tsx` — bottom sheet with create/join/copy-code UI and live peer list. FocusScreen: "🤝 Focus with someone" button (idle state) → opens sheet. Room active chip shows peer count. In-session: peer phase dots + S-11 encouragement text replaces Ambient Orbit pill when room active.
- **Task Reordering (Sprint Y):** `TasksPage.tsx` — `DndContext` + `SortableContext` wraps NOW and NEXT pool lists. `SortableTaskCard` uses `useSortable` from `@dnd-kit/sortable`. `handleDragEnd` calls `reorderPool(pool, arrayMove(tasks, oldIdx, newIdx))`. Store: `reorderPool(pool, ordered)` updates `position` field on each task. PointerSensor (distance: 6) + TouchSensor (delay: 200ms) for mobile hold-to-drag.
- **Session History (Sprint Z):** `src/features/history/HistoryPage.tsx` — `/history` route (lazy). Groups raw sessions from `useSessionHistory` by date. Shows duration / phase (color-coded) / energy before→after emojis per session. Summary strip: total sessions / total minutes / flow-session count. Guest → sign-in prompt. Empty → encouraging empty state. Linked from ProgressPage via "📋 Session Log →" row. S-7 `SessionFrictionNudge` component in `AppShell.tsx` — detects `prevPath === '/focus' && currPath !== '/focus' && isInFocus` → shows 5s auto-dismiss teal pill.

## Architecture (Sprints U–W additions)
- **Weekly Planning Ritual (Sprint U):** `src/features/focus/WeeklyPlanning.tsx` — lazy z-50. 3 steps: recap (completedTotal + currentStreak mini-cards) → intention chip picker (4 options: consistent/challenge/recover/explore) → closing affirmation. Auto-advances on chip pick (220ms). `finish()` calls `setWeeklyIntention('emoji label')`. Store: `weeklyPlanShownWeek: string|null`, `weeklyIntention: string|null` (both persisted). Trigger in `App.tsx`: Sunday 18pm+ or Monday before noon; ISO week key computed with Sunday→next-week offset. Mutually exclusive with all other overlays (lowest priority).
- **Task Notes (Sprint V):** `note?: string` added to `Task` interface (`types/index.ts`). `AddTaskModal`: `showNote` state; initially shows "+ Add context (optional)" link; click expands animated textarea. `note.trim() || undefined` written to task. `TaskCard`: shows `📝 {note}` 1-line preview below title when present. Memo comparator includes `note` field.
- **Adaptive Focus Setup (Sprint W):** `FocusScreen.tsx` setup screen: (1) Today's Progress strip — shows `completedTotal` + `todayFocusMin` (from weeklyStats.dailyMinutes[(day+6)%7]) + weeklyIntention chip; only renders when any value >0 or intention set. (2) Adaptive ADHD tip card — 4 variants from `timeBlindness` (often/sometimes) + `emotionalReactivity` (high/moderate); teal-tinted card; returns null for non-ADHD profiles. Both values come from new store destructure in `FocusScreen.tsx`.

## Architecture (Sprint N additions)
- **O-9 Full surprise timer:** `ArcTimer.tsx` — `progressStroke = isSurprise ? 'transparent' : arcColor`. Progress arc becomes invisible; background ring track still renders as passive visual anchor. `FocusScreen.tsx` — wraps entire duration preset block in `{timerStyle !== 'surprise' && ...}`. In surprise mode renders "🎲 Surprise mode" info card instead. Digits were already hidden (Sprint K). Now truly time-blind: no arc, no digits, only orb.
- **O-7 Psychotype re-derivation:** `src/shared/lib/psychotype.ts` (NEW) — `deriveFromSessions(sessions: FocusSessionRow[]): Psychotype | null`. 4 scoring axes: achiever (deep-focus rate + avg session length), explorer (duration stdDev + hour stdDev), connector (unique active days / 30 + energy delta), planner (hour stdDev < 5 + duration consistency). Returns null if score < 2 or < 10 sessions. `useSessionHistory` exposes `sessions: FocusSessionRow[]`. Store: `psychotypeLastDerived: string|null`, `setPsychotype`, `setPsychotypeLastDerived` (all persisted). `ProgressPage` "Your Focus Style" card: current type emoji+desc always shown; amber evolution nudge + Update CTA when derived ≠ current.

## Architecture (Sprint M additions)
- **O-6 ADHD signal:** `OnboardingPage.tsx` — 2 new steps (index 3 & 4) replace deprecated cognitiveMode step. `TIME_BLINDNESS_MAP: ['often','sometimes','rarely']`, `EMOTIONAL_REACTIVITY_MAP: ['high','moderate','steady']`. Store: `timeBlindness`, `emotionalReactivity` (both persisted). `setTimeBlindness`, `setEmotionalReactivity` setters. Option cards auto-advance with 160ms delay (removes need for Continue button on card-select steps).
- **O-11 Revisit mode:** `OnboardingPage.tsx` reads `onboardingCompleted` from store. `isRevisit = onboardingCompleted`. `initialSelections` pre-fills from store values via `modeToIdx/tbToIdx/erToIdx` helpers (run once at mount). `finish()` skips `setOnboardingCompleted()` and calls `navigate(-1)` on revisit. "Refreshing your profile 🔧" banner shown at top.
- **O-12 Peak Focus Window:** `ProgressPage.tsx` — new card between Energy Trends and Share button. Shows `weeklyStats.peakFocusTime` (teal) + `weeklyStats.consistencyScore × 7` days active (indigo). Only renders when `peakFocusTime !== 'Not enough data'`. Data already computed by `useSessionHistory` → `computeWeeklyStats`.
- **energy_after (Known Gap resolved):** `useFocusSession.ts` — `savedSessionIdRef.current` captures DB row ID after session save. `handlePostEnergy` calls `supabase.from('focus_sessions').update({ energy_after: level }).eq('id', savedSessionIdRef.current)`. This was already implemented; marking as resolved.

## Architecture (Sprint L additions)
- **Medication peak window (B-12):** `FocusScreen.tsx` — `MED_PEAK_HOURS` map (morning=[8,11], afternoon=[13,16], evening=[17,20]). `getMedPeakLabel()` returns pill string if current hour is in window and `medicationEnabled`. `medPeakLabel` via `useMemo`. Badge renders above Start button in indigo-tinted pill. Non-blocking, no DB write.
- **Monthly Reflection (B-5):** `src/features/focus/MonthlyReflection.tsx` — lazy loaded, z-50. 3 steps: recap (completedTotal + longestStreak) → 1-word intention (quick-pick chips + free input) → closing auto-dismiss 3s. `monthlyReflectionShownMonth: string | null` in store (persisted as 'YYYY-MM'). `setMonthlyReflectionShownMonth`. Triggers in App.tsx when `currentDay <= 5 && monthlyReflectionShownMonth !== currentMonth`. Mutually exclusive with all other overlays (lowest priority).
- **Settings Medication section:** Toggle + 3 time chips (morning/afternoon/evening). Wired to `medicationEnabled/setMedicationEnabled` + `medicationTime/setMedicationTime` from store.
- **Settings Preferences section:** "Re-run setup wizard" button → `navigate('/onboarding')`.
- **i18n foundation:** `src/shared/lib/i18n/en.ts` (source of truth, typed `I18nKey`), `ru.ts` (partial override), `index.ts` (resolveLocale + t() with `{{placeholder}}` interpolation, auto-fallback to en). `src/shared/hooks/useI18n.ts` — `{ t, locale }`, locale resolved once per mount from `navigator.language`. Greeting in `HomePage` wired to `t('home.greeting.*')`. EN+RU strings cover: greetings, home, focus, tasks, settings, generic.

## Architecture (Sprint K additions)
- **Surprise timer orb:** `ArcTimer.tsx` — in surprise mode, center shows `motion.div` with radial-gradient pulsing animation (scale 0.7→1.15→0.7, opacity 0.2→0.55→0.2, 3.5s loop). Respects `reducedMotion`.
- **Hyperfocus Autopsy:** `PostSessionFlow.tsx` `NatureBuffer` — accepts `sessionMinutes?: number` prop. When ≥45: shows 3-option reflection card above energy check-in. Local state `autopsyPick` tracks selection. Non-blocking, no DB write yet (future sprint).
- **Two-Thirds guardrail:** TasksPage NEXT header shows "filling up" amber badge when `nextTasks.length >= 4`. AddTaskModal shows gentle warning when `nextCount >= 4 && isFull`. Never blocking.
- **native.ts:** `src/shared/lib/native.ts` — zero TS imports of @capacitor. Uses `window.Capacitor.Plugins` for runtime access. Exports: `isNativeApp`, `nativeHapticImpact/Notification/Selection`, `nativeStatusBarHide/Show/Dark`, `nativeShare`, `canShare`. FocusScreen calls hide/show on screen state changes.
- **Web Share:** ProgressPage imports `nativeShare + canShare`. Share button conditionally shown. Shares weekly focus minutes + completedTotal.
- **PWA manifest:** `public/manifest.json` — 4 shortcuts, categories, screenshots, edge_side_panel. Linked via `<link rel="manifest">` in index.html.

## Architecture (Sprint J additions)
- **Voice input:** `AddTaskModal` has mic button (Lucide `Mic`/`MicOff`/`Loader2`). Uses `window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition`. On transcript: calls `classify-voice-input` edge function → auto-fills title, difficulty, duration, dueDate. Falls back to raw transcript if API fails. `voiceSupported` flag hides button if API unavailable.
- **Smart duration:** `SMART_DURATION: Record<1|2|3, number> = {1:15, 2:25, 3:45}`. Auto-applied when difficulty changes unless user manually picked a duration (`minutesManuallySet` ref). "✨ smart" badge shown when auto-mode active.
- **ShutdownRitual:** `src/features/focus/ShutdownRitual.tsx` — lazy loaded, z-50. 3 steps: wins review / set tomorrow's ONE thing / goodnight. Creates NEXT task with tomorrow's dueDate. Store field: `shutdownShownDate` (ISO date, persisted). Triggered once per day after 9pm from App.tsx useEffect. All three overlays (Recovery / ContextRestore / Shutdown) are mutually exclusive.
- **Auto-reschedule banner:** `TasksPage` detects `[...nowPool, ...nextPool].filter(active && dueDate < TODAY)`. Gold `<button>` navigates to `/calendar`. Non-shaming copy.
- **Capacitor:** `capacitor.config.ts` at project root. `appId: com.mindshift.app`. Config includes SplashScreen/StatusBar/Keyboard/LocalNotifications/PushNotifications. `package.json` scripts: `cap:sync`, `cap:ios`, `cap:android`, `cap:run:android`. Install step: `npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/ios @capacitor/android` (not committed — user runs once).

## Architecture (Sprint I additions)
- **idbStorage:** `src/shared/lib/idbStorage.ts` — Zustand `StateStorage` adapter using `idb-keyval`. Transparent migration: reads localStorage on first load, migrates to IDB, removes from localStorage. Replaces 5MB localStorage limit.
- **Invisible streaks:** `currentStreak / longestStreak / lastActiveDate` in store. Tracked inside `completeTask`. Shown in HomePage only when `currentStreak >= 2`. Never shames on break.
- **Haptic engine:** 9 ADHD-safe patterns in `haptic.ts`. All focus-session events (start/phase/end/breathe) now have distinct patterns. Works on Android Chrome; silently fails on iOS.
- **AudioPreset + Sound section:** Settings → Sound: 5 presets (brown/pink/nature/lofi/gamma), preview button, "lock as focus anchor" button, volume slider. `focusAnchor` persisted in store.
- **Phase-adaptive audio:** `adaptToPhase(phase)` on `useAudioEngine` hook. Called from `useFocusSession` on every `sessionPhase` change. 1.5s smooth ramp via Web Audio `setTargetAtTime`.
- **BreathworkRitual:** `src/features/focus/BreathworkRitual.tsx` — 3-cycle breathwork overlay before focus session. Pulsing SVG orb, haptic sync, progress dots, skip button. Respects `reducedMotion`.
- **Low-energy auto-simplify:** `isLowEnergy = energyLevel <= 2 || burnoutScore > 60`. When true: 1 NOW task shown, NEXT pool hidden, BentoGrid hidden, gentle banner shown.
- **Mochi energy reactions:** `MOCHI_ENERGY_MESSAGES` pool (5 levels × 3 messages). Speech bubble appears on homepage when energy changes, auto-dismisses after 5s.
- **Locale injection:** `navigator.language` BCP-47 code injected into all 3 AI edge functions (decompose-task/recovery-message/weekly-insight). Gemini responds in user's language natively.
- **Spiciness meter:** 5-chip overwhelm picker in `RecoveryProtocol`. Value 1–5 maps to step count (5-7/3-5/2-3) and granularity in `decompose-task` edge function. Defaults to 3 (moderate).

## Architecture (Sprint B additions)
- **SEASONAL_MODE_CONFIG:** `constants.ts` — each seasonalMode (launch/maintain/recover/sandbox) has `nowPoolMaxOverride` (null = defer to appMode).
- **getNowPoolMax(appMode, seasonalMode):** helper composing both configs. Used in NowPoolWidget + AddTaskModal + SettingsScreen toast.
- **cognitiveMode:** Deprecated in UI (Sprint B). Field kept in store for localStorage compat. Not set from any UI anymore.
- **DIFFICULTY_MAP:** `types/index.ts` — `1|2|3 → { label, color }`. Single source of truth. Replaces hardcoded ternaries and deprecated `difficultyLevel` string field.
- **DueDateScreen reschedule:** Task rows are `<button>` — tap opens spring-animated bottom sheet with date input, "Go to task →", and "Remove due date".
- **Carry-over badge:** Now a `<button>` with AnimatePresence popover (Park it / Move to Someday / Still on it). Outside-click closes via `useRef` + `useEffect`.
- **Mochi psychotype overlay:** `MochiSessionCompanion` now reads `psychotype` from store and picks per-psychotype messages (achiever/explorer/connector/planner × 4 milestones).
- **FirstTaskPrompt reset:** `useEffect` in HomeScreen resets `firstTaskDismissed` whenever `activeNowTasks.length === 0`.
- **/audio route removed:** `AudioScreen` lazy import + `/audio` route deleted from App.tsx (dead route, nothing linked to it).

## Architecture (Sprint A additions)
- **APP_MODE_CONFIG:** `constants.ts` — each appMode (minimal/habit/system) now drives `nowPoolMax`, `showNextOnHome`, `showSomedayOnHome`, `homeSubtitle`. Single source of truth.
- **Done recently:** TasksScreen collapsible section — `[...nowPool, ...nextPool, ...somedayPool].filter(completed, <7d)`, sorted by `completedAt` desc.
- **Store hydration pruning:** `onRehydrateStorage` callback prunes completed tasks >30d from all pools.
- **Rest-mode banner:** HomeScreen + App.tsx show banner when `flexiblePauseUntil` is in the future.
- **Energy tracking:** `energy_before` now written from current `energyLevel` on session save. `energy_after` still pending PostSessionFlow wiring.

## Build Notes (important!)
- **Gate command: `tsc -b`** (not `tsc --noEmit` — the latter misses `noUnusedLocals` and stricter generics)
- Sprint D–H: `tsc -b` ✅, `npm run build` ✅ (38 precache entries), `npx playwright test` 132/132 ✅
- Sprint BB: `tsc -b` ✅, dead code removed (655 lines), CORS hardened, store fixed
- Sprint BC: `tsc -b` ✅, FocusScreen decomposed, dateUtils centralised
- Always run `tsc -b` before any commit. Use `/verify` command in Claude Code.

## Production Status (as of Sprint H — 16 March 2026)
| Item | Code | Deployed | Notes |
|------|------|----------|-------|
| Vercel hosting | ✅ vercel.json | ✅ live | Verified by Yusif. App opens. |
| Supabase DB | ✅ migrations exist | ✅ live | Verified by Yusif. Auth works. |
| Edge functions | ✅ 6 functions written | ❓ unconfirmed | Need: `supabase functions list` to verify |
| Env vars (Vercel) | ✅ .env exists | ✅ assumed | App works → vars must be set |
| Data persistence (tasks etc.) | ✅ code ready | ❓ untested | Only 1 user (Yusif). Needs real session test. |
| Sentry | ✅ DSN configured, deferred init | ❓ unconfirmed | Check sentry.io → Issues |
| Analytics | ✅ @vercel/analytics + web-vitals | ❓ unconfirmed | Check Vercel dashboard → Analytics tab |
| Stripe / Payments | ❌ not implemented | ❌ planned | ProBanner UI removed (Sprint A). Store logic intact. |
| Real users | 1 (Yusif only) | — | Design + auth issues resolved. Ready for beta invites. |

## Known Gaps (not yet implemented)
- ~~**energy_after**~~ ✅ Resolved Sprint M — `handlePostEnergy` in `useFocusSession.ts` calls `supabase.update({ energy_after: level })` using `savedSessionIdRef.current`.
- **Server-side push (v2)** — SW showNotification works when tab is in background (Sprint F). Full push when app is closed needs VAPID keys + Supabase cron.
- **Stripe integration** — subscriptionTier exists in store, ProBanner UI removed (Sprint A). Zero payment logic. Restore ProBanner when Stripe ready.
- **classify-voice-input** — edge function written + wired in AddTaskModal. Unconfirmed in production (`supabase functions list` to verify).
- ~~**Social layer**~~ ✅ Sprint X — Focus Rooms via Supabase Realtime presence.
- **Health signals** — sleepQuality, chronotype, medicationTime removed from UI (Sprint A). Store fields remain. Re-add when wired to recommendations.
- **Google OAuth setup** — Code ready (Sprint AA). Requires: Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Google → Enable + set Client ID/Secret from Google Cloud Console.
- **user_behavior table** — Schema defined in types/database.ts. `useUserBehavior` hook computes behavior profile client-side. Server-side aggregation (populating `user_behavior` table via cron) is a future optimization.

## Architecture (Sprint O–Q additions)
- **Daily focus goal (P-1):** `dailyFocusGoalMin: number` (default 60) + `goalCelebratedDate: string|null` persisted in store. `useAmbientOrbit` hook in FocusScreen queries Supabase count. HomePage: today's progress bar using `weeklyStats.dailyMinutes[(getDay()+6)%7]`; teal when goal reached; one-time toast via `setGoalCelebratedDate`. Settings: 30/45/60/90 chip picker.
- **Recurring tasks:** `repeat: 'none'|'daily'|'weekly'` on `Task` type. `completeTask` creates next occurrence with `+1/+7` day `dueDate` when `repeat !== 'none'`. AddTaskModal: Once/Daily/Weekly chips.
- **Task search:** `searchQuery` state in TasksPage; filters all three pools simultaneously via useMemo with case-insensitive `.includes()`. Lucide `Search`/`X` icons.
- **Ambient Orbit (S-2):** `useAmbientOrbit(active)` in `FocusScreen.tsx` — Supabase `count` query on `focus_sessions` WHERE `started_at > now()-30m`; refreshes every 5 min; teal pill fades in with 10s delay at 55% opacity; `pointer-events:none`.
